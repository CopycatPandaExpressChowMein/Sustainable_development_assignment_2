# Introduction
--------------------------
This Group project was written in HT25 to be submitted for Examination 2 of the course **Methods of Sustainable Programming** - **DA214A**.

The main goal with this project was to write a small Terminal game in line with the requirements presented in the Examination. With a focus on teamwork, OOP and unittesting.

**OBS!** Note that instructions for the following segments were written with Git Bash in mind, meaning that the commands may not look the exact same for a different Terminal.

# Installation
--------------------------
There are two main ways to install the game:
- Download the game as a Zip file and Unzip
- Clone the Repo

## Cloning a Repo

To clone the repo, simply open the terminal and enter

This will clone the report to the directory the terminal is currently open in.
