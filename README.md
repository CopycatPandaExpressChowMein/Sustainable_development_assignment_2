# Introduction
--------------------------
This Group project was written in HT25 to be submitted for Examination 2 of the course **Methods of Sustainable Programming** - **DA214A**.

The main goal with this project was to write a small Terminal game in line with the requirements presented in the Examination. With a focus on teamwork, OOP and unittesting.

**OBS!** Note that instructions for the following segments were written with Git Bash in mind, meaning that the commands may not look the exact same for a different Terminal.
